# NMEUtil

A modding thing for MP2D `DEMO v0.1.21.4.1A 2021`.

# Why?

The game had received a DMCA takedown, as such no official updates will ever be produced.

So... why not let the community do the improvements? :p

# How to use?

- Unpack all files from the release zip into the game folder.

- Edit `Initial.lua` to your liking, might also want to peek at other lua files.

- Run `NMEUtil.exe` and enjoy the game!

# How to revert?

Simply run the game as usual, via `PlayPrime2D.exe` instead of `NMEUtil.exe`.

The game will ignore any mods.

# Caveats?

- No live update, you have to restart the game for Initial.lua to be reloaded.
  ...or you can write your own live update if you want, it's not hard.

- The NMEv4 API is not documented *at all*.
  ...I am working on it, by dumping parts of the game's code, this will take some time.
  (not my fault that the engine is private!)

- NMA files (aka the game assets) cannot be edited.
  ...I and my friends over at VULKAN SYSTEMS are working on it, we don't promise anything!
